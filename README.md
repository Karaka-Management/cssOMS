The cssOMS framework is primarily developed for the Karaka application which is a modular web application for small to mid sized companies that need CRM, ERP, Intranet and/or CMS functionalities and much more. The framework is also used in some other tools and websites which compliment the Karaka web application and provides the necessary basic CSS.

With Orange-Management you have one partner who can provide all the tools and software solutions you are used to at fair and reasonable prices even for small organizations and companies/startups. Our solutions can be used independently from each other or fully integrated with other solutions we provide. By choosing Orange-Management as your partner you'll be able to adjust your software based on the changes in your requirements without worrying about integration and workflow optimization.

## Installation

### Requirements

In order to re-build the css from the scss files you need scss. The file which includes all necessary imports and should be built is called `styles.scss`.

### Setup

You can either link the `styles.css` in the head of your output file or choose the single styles which you need for the respective application.

## Philosophy

We believe software should support a business in it's daily tasks and growth in a very efficient way without frustration. In order to achieve this we constantly take feedback from our customers and expand and improve our software solutions.

Since we believe in our software and transparent business model you can live test parts of our application and it's modules in our demo application at https://karaka.app (user: admin, pass: orange) without any registration or inquiry. This can be done even during the development phase.

## Development Status

Currently Karaka is still developing the first Alpha version. As soon as we have a running Beta version we are allowing external testers to use our software and a selected amount of inhouse developed modules. The cssOMS style framework is one of the least developed components and still requires many improvements in terms of visuals, missing styles and mobile support.

General updates can be found in our info section at https://karaka.app/info and developer updates can be found in our developer section at https://karaka.app/dev. In our developer section you can also check out the automatically generated reports such as code coverage, code style, static analysis etc. as well as our code style guide lines and developer documentation.

## Tests

In order to see and test the styles by themselves you can clone the framework as well as the `jsOMS` repository and run the `cssOMS/tests/app/index.htm` file. Feel free to modify the scss files and test the results in this sandboxed page.
